    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This is the beginning of my project where I will be collecting all of the necessary data to fine-tune my LLM. I will be using the `PRAW` library to scrape posts and collect the following fields:\n",
    "- `post.id`: Used for partition key\n",
    "- `post.title`: Title of the post\n",
    "- `post.selftext`: The body of the post\n",
    "- `post.url`: This is the image or video\n",
    "- `post.created_utc`: Datetime of post\n",
    "- `post.score`: Number of upvotes\n",
    "- `post.num_comments`: Number of comments\n",
    "- `top_comment.body`: Text of the top comment\n",
    "- `top_comment.score`: Number of upvotes for the top comment\n",
    "\n",
    "Because BLIP is an image-to-text model, **I am going to keep the scope of post.urls to .png and .jpg files.** GIFs and videos won't be processed, but instead their descriptions will be inferred using few-shot learning with GPT-4."
